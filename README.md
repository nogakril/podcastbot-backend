# PodcastBot Backend

**PodcastBot** invites participants to transcribe their stream of thoughts and record a short podcast, hosted by a generative AI bot. Participants choose the topic, and the bot’s questions are guided by the participant’s own responses. This backend supports the AI-driven conversational flow showcased during the Jerusalem Design Week Exhibition.

##  How It Works

- **Speech-to-Text Flow**  
  Participants speak freely—stream-of-consciousness style. Their speech is transcribed in real time using a speech-to-text engine.

- **Conversational AI Bot**  
  The AI bot analyzes the user’s latest response and generates contextually relevant follow-up questions, creating a dynamic, semi-guided conversation.

- **Podcast Recording**  
  The interaction is recorded as a short “podcast” episode, layering human thought and bot-driven prompts into a reflective audio stream.
